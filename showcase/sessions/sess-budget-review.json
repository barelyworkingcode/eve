          "text": "I've reviewed both documents. Here's the analysis:\n\n## Budget vs Actuals Comparison\n\n### Departments Trending Over Budget\n\n**1. Engineering -- Over by 12%**\n- Q4 2025 actual: $485K (budget: $430K)\n- Primary driver: Two unplanned contractor hires for the analytics pipeline rebuild\n- 2026 budget allocates $1.72M but doesn't account for continued contractor costs\n- **Risk**: If contractors extend past March, engineering will exceed annual budget by ~$180K\n\n**2. Sales & Marketing -- Over by 8%**\n- Q4 2025 actual: $162K (budget: $150K)\n- Overspend came from the enterprise launch campaign ($18K over on paid acquisition)\n- 2026 budget increased to $680K but front-loads spend in Q1-Q2\n- **Risk**: Moderate. Front-loaded spend is intentional per strategic plan, but CAC is $340 vs target of $280\n\n### Departments On Track\n\n**3. Operations -- Under by 3%**\n- Q4 2025 actual: $97K (budget: $100K)\n- 2026 budget of $410K looks appropriate based on run rate\n\n**4. G&A -- On budget**\n- Q4 2025 actual: $88K (budget: $90K)\n- 2026 budget of $365K reflects expected office lease renewal\n\n## Key Flags\n\n1. **Contractor costs not budgeted**: The $180K gap in engineering needs board attention. Either convert contractors to FTE (cheaper long-term) or add a line item.\n\n2. **CAC trending high**: Sales is spending more per customer than planned. Worth reviewing the channel mix -- paid acquisition is expensive vs the outbound motion that was working in Q3.\n\n3. **Infrastructure costs missing**: I don't see AWS/cloud costs broken out separately. They're buried in engineering but growing 15% QoQ. Should be a separate line item for visibility.\n\nWant me to draft a variance memo for the finance team?"

Could potentially save 15-20% on a 2-year commitment."
