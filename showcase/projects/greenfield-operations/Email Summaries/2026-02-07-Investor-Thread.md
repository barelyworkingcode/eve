### Thread: Series A Term Sheet Discussion

**Participants**: Sarah Chen (GV), James Whitfield (Ridge Capital), Michael Torres (Clearwater Ventures)

**Summary**:

James Whitfield (Ridge Capital) shared their updated view on the Series A. Key points:

1. **Valuation concern**: Enterprise SaaS multiples have compressed 15-20% in Q1 2026 across the sector. Ridge's investment committee is comfortable at $18M pre-money but would need to see Q1 revenue above $500K to support the $22M target.

2. **Round size**: Ridge proposes $8M at $18M pre-money (30.8% dilution). At $22M, the same $8M gives 26.7% dilution.

3. **Timeline**: Ridge wants to close by end of March. Term sheet review deadline remains February 15.

**New development**: Michael Torres from Clearwater Ventures reached out expressing interest in participating after seeing GV's Q4 metrics shared during a co-investor meeting. Clearwater would add $2-3M to the round.

**Sarah's response**: Acknowledged the market conditions. Asked the board to consider whether closing faster at $18M is strategically better than waiting for Q1 results to support $22M. The $4M valuation difference translates to ~4% additional dilution.

**Open questions for board**:
- Accept $18M to close quickly, or wait for Q1 data to support $22M?
- Include Clearwater? Adding $2-3M increases round to $10-11M but adds another investor to cap table
- If Clearwater joins at $18M, total round of $10-11M means ~38% dilution -- is that acceptable?

**Next step**: Board discussion at February 18 meeting. Sarah preparing financial models for both scenarios.
