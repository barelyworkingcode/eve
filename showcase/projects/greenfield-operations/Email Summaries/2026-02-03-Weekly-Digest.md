### Key Threads

**1. Engineering -- Analytics Pipeline Performance** (Alex Rivera -> Marcus Webb)
The pipeline rebuild shipped Friday. Initial metrics show 40% latency improvement on dashboard queries. Three enterprise customers confirmed faster load times. One edge case identified: queries spanning > 90 days timeout on large datasets. Jordan is investigating.

**2. Sales -- Enterprise Pipeline Update** (Priya Patel -> Sarah Chen)
12 qualified opportunities in Q1 pipeline. Two are in final contract negotiation (combined $180K ARR). Lost one deal to CompetitorX on pricing -- they're offering 30% below our rates. Priya recommends holding price and competing on integration depth.

**3. Partnerships -- Acme Corp API Rate Limits** (David Kim -> Marcus Webb)
Three joint customers hit the 10K/day API rate limit this week. Acme's Jennifer Park says their engineering team can increase the limit but wants it included in the MOU renewal. David flagged that the renewal notice deadline has passed.

**4. Finance -- Q4 Close** (Lisa Tran -> All Leads)
Q4 books are closed. Revenue came in at $420K (+10.5% vs budget). Engineering overspent by $55K primarily from contractor costs. Lisa requests all departments submit Q1 budget adjustment requests by Feb 14.

**5. HR -- Recruiting Pipeline** (Sarah Chen -> Marcus Webb, Priya Patel)
3 senior backend candidates in final interviews. 1 frontend candidate accepted offer, starting Feb 24 (Yuki's team). SDR recruiting paused until after Series A close to manage burn.
