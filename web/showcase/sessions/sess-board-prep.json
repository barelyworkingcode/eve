          "text": "## Acme Corp MOU Summary\n\n**Current Agreement**: Signed June 15, 2025 | Expires June 14, 2026\n\n### Key Terms\n\n| Term | Current | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue Share | 15% of joint customer revenue | Below market (typical: 20-25%) |\n| Data Sharing | Aggregated analytics only | No PII exchange |\n| Exclusivity | Non-exclusive | Either party can partner with competitors |\n| Integration | API access to Acme's customer data pipeline | Rate-limited to 10K requests/day |\n| Support | Dedicated integration engineer from each side | Currently Marcus is covering this |\n| Renewal | 30-day written notice required | **Notice period passed without action** |\n\n### Renegotiation Points\n\n**1. Revenue Share (Priority: High)**\nThe 15% rate was set when we had no leverage. With 34 enterprise customers now using the joint integration, we should push for 20% or a tiered structure based on volume.\n\n**2. API Rate Limits (Priority: High)**\nThe 10K/day limit is constraining. Several enterprise customers have hit it. Need minimum 50K/day or usage-based scaling.\n\n**3. Auto-Renewal Clause (Priority: Medium)**\nAdd auto-renewal language to avoid this situation again. Standard: 1-year auto-renewal with 90-day opt-out notice.\n\n**4. Dedicated Support (Priority: Medium)**\nMarcus shouldn't be the integration engineer. Either Acme provides dedicated support or we hire for it (budget in engineering plan).\n\n**5. Exclusivity (Priority: Low)**\nConsider requesting a 6-month exclusivity window for new verticals we jointly enter. Gives us first-mover advantage.\n\n### Immediate Action Needed\n\nSince the 30-day notice period has passed without either party acting, the agreement technically auto-continues on current terms month-to-month (per Section 8.2). David Kim should send a formal amendment request letter this week to begin renegotiation while the existing terms remain in effect."

Acme Corp Partnership Renewal** -- David Kim (10 min)\n>    - Current MOU status (overdue renewal notice)\n>    - Proposed renegotiation terms: revenue share, API limits, support model\n>    - Board approval for amendment request\n>    - Timeline: send formal letter by Feb 21\n\n## Investor Thread Highlights\n\nFrom the February 7 investor email thread, two items warrant board attention:\n\n**1. Series A Lead Investor Concern -- Market Timing**\nThe lead investor (Ridge Capital) flagged concern about enterprise SaaS valuations compressing in Q1 2026. They're suggesting we consider closing at a lower valuation ($18M) faster rather than holding out for the $22M target. Sarah should brief the board on this trade-off.\n\n**Suggested agenda addition to Item 2 (CEO Update):**\n> - Series A valuation discussion: speed vs. target valuation\n> - Ridge Capital's market timing analysis\n\n**2. Follow-on Investor Interest**\nClearwater Ventures expressed interest in participating in the round after seeing our Q4 metrics. This could increase the round size but may complicate the cap table.\n\n**Suggested agenda addition to Item 2 (CEO Update):**\n> - Clearwater Ventures participation: round size implications\n\nBoth of these are time-sensitive given the February 15 term sheet deadline. The board should be prepared to make a decision on valuation target at this meeting."
