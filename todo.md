# Test backlog — integration layer (and adjacent)

Status (2026-06-14): **unit 476 · integration 33 (1 skipped) · e2e 3 — all green.**

Integration tests live in `test/integration/` (`npm run test:integration`). They spawn the
real `node server.js` against the in-process fake relay (`fake-relay.js`) on an ephemeral
loopback port — no real relay / relayLLM / LLM / passkey. The fake plays the project +
session store and scripts the relay→eve WS stream from the contract in `protocol.js`.

Already covered: auth status, project list + CRUD, file list/read/write, path-traversal
reject, `dir_changed` watcher, session create + default/scripted/error streams, module-AI
invocation (`__module:` interception + cleanup), resilience (dead-relay error, local ops
survive relay-down, reconnect), and the protocol contract (fake-frame validity).

## Integration tests still to write

### Sessions / relay forwarding
- [x] Lifecycle ops forward the correct frame to relay — assert the fake **receives**
      leave / end / delete / rename / set_session_folder / stop_generation /
      set_permission_mode. _(session-forwarding.test.js)_
- [ ] `stop_generation` mid-stream halts rendering and resets TTS state. _(forwarding
      covered above; the TTS-state reset is internal — better as a relay-client unit test)_
- [x] All three assistant-text shapes stream through (`assistantMessage` +
      `assistantContentBlock` added). _(session-forwarding.test.js)_

### Permissions
- [x] `permission_request` (relay→browser) → `permission_response` (browser→relay) round-trip.
      _(permissions.test.js)_ — `alwaysAllow` auto-approve still TODO.

### Terminals
- [x] `terminal_create` → relay; relay `terminal_output` → browser; input/resize/close forward.
      _(terminals.test.js)_
- [ ] `terminal_list` / `terminal_templates` proxy.

### Tasks / scheduler WS (second upstream `/ws/tasks`)
- [x] task events (`task_started/completed`) forwarded to the browser
      (`relay-client._connectScheduler`). _(tasks.test.js)_ — reconnect-after-drop still TODO.
- [x] `GET /api/tasks` proxy. _(tasks.test.js)_ — create / run / delete still TODO.

### Search (local ripgrep — no fake relay involved)
- [x] `search_project` over a real project with content → `search_results` (real rg);
      empty result set; unknown-project error. _(search.test.js)_
- [ ] `search_cancel` cancels an in-flight search; truncation/cap behavior.
- [ ] `search_ai_summarize` — fake handles the `__search:` hidden session, streams a summary,
      session DELETEd afterward (mirror the module-ai test).

### File ops (extend local-surface)
- [x] `rename_file` / `move_file` / `upload_file` over WS. _(file-ops.test.js)_
- [x] `watch_file` → external content edit → `file_changed` (with content). _(file-ops.test.js)_
- [x] `module_read_file` / `module_write_file` — server-side `permissions.files` gate over WS
      (permitted path succeeds, denied path is refused). _(file-ops.test.js)_

### UI command bus (eve-control MCP)
- [x] `POST /internal/ui-command` with `EVE_INTERNAL_SECRET` + a viewing browser → `ui_command`
      reaches the right browser; wrong secret → 401; no viewer → no_client. _(ui-command.test.js)_

### Binary proxies
- [x] `GET /api/generated/:filename` and `/api/terminals/:id/log` (`fetchRaw`) — content-type
      + cache headers. _(binary-proxy.test.js)_

---

## Adjacent follow-ups (not strictly integration)

### Contract — record & verify  ← HIGH VALUE
- [ ] Wire `contract.test.js`'s skipped `EVE_CONTRACT=1` block to a **live relay**: capture real
      relay→eve frames from a session, assert each passes `validateRelayFrame`, and that ≥1
      `llm_event` yields non-empty `extractAssistantText`. This is what catches relayLLM changing
      a frame shape under the fake. (The fake was already missing `event.v=2` — caught by E2E.)

### E2E (Playwright, `test/e2e/`, `npm run test:e2e`)
- [ ] Passkey enroll/login via the CDP **virtual authenticator** (the only flow not on the
      loopback bypass).
- [ ] File editor: open a file (Monaco), edit, save → `file_saved` + on disk.
- [ ] Reconnect banner: drop/restart the WS → `ws-client` auto-reconnect UX.
- [ ] Permission prompt modal: `permission_request` → modal → allow / deny.

### CI
- [ ] Run integration + e2e as separate CI jobs (keep the pre-commit hook unit-only).
- [ ] Decide cadence for the `EVE_CONTRACT=1` live-relay job (needs the real stack).

## Notes / gotchas (learned building this)
- **Loopback is a trusted subnet** → no passkey for harness tests; passkey stays manual / CDP.
- **Projects are relay-owned** (eve only caches them); the fake must supply the project→path
  mapping even for "local" file tests.
- **Browser-bound frames are coalesced** into a `__batch` (24 ms); the harness WS client unwraps it.
- **`llm_event` inner events MUST carry `v: 2`** or the client drops them (encoded in `protocol.js`).
